      <p>ABOUT US</p>
      <p>We are the "Astronauts In The Ocean" team from the NASA Space Apps community. Our goal with this book is to explain real science in a fun and simple way, so that children can easily understand it.</p>
    </div>
<div class="main"> <div class="block"> <h1>What is space weather?</h1> <p>Space weather is caused by activity on the Sun — like solar flares and solar wind — that can affect Earth and space systems. Even though the Sun is far away, its energy can disrupt satellites, GPS, radio signals, and even power grids. NASA studies these solar events to better predict and prepare for them. It works with other agencies and uses spacecraft to monitor the Sun in real time. Space weather is especially important for protecting astronauts and missions to the Moon and Mars. Understanding it helps reduce risks to both technology and human life.</p> <p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/space-weather/" class="link">Learn more...</a></p> </div>

        <p><strong>DAY 1, TUESDAY</strong></p>
        <p>Today is the day I’ve been waiting for the most. My younger self has been dreaming about it ever since the first time I saw this beautiful planet from afar. I’m traveling to planet Earth! And I am honestly so happy but scared at the same time, because what if people will stare at me and laugh? I believe that I will find someone who won’t judge me and tell me more about this wonderful place. I already prepared some gifts from Mars, hope they’ll like it!</p>

        <p><em>* A WHILE LATER *</em></p>
        <p>I’m sitting in the spaceship right now, and still can’t believe this is real. The seat is shaking a little as the engines start. Outside the window, I can see the red surface of Mars, my home, getting smaller and smaller. The stars outside look majestic. I keep thinking about Earth – what it looks like, how people live there and do they know about Mars?</p>

        <p><strong>RIGHT AFTER I LANDED</strong></p>
        <p>I’m finally here! It feels so strange and unfamiliar but I’m so excited to meet new people and learn about the conditions of this planet. It’s dark here and different from pictures that I saw in the books. It was such a long and exhausting way, so I’ll rest for a little. I’ll write more after a little nap</p>

        <p><strong>DAY 2</strong></p>
        <p>Oh my God! I slept for so long and the sky became so different! It’s not dark anymore and I’m so surprised, because it’s unusual for me. And also the weather is so weird. there is no reddish dust and global dust storms. That’s why it feels so extraordinary. My plan for today is just to explore this planet and find how the Sun works here, and of course it’s impact on people. But firstly, I want to try their food!</p>

        <p><em>A LITTLE BIT LATER</em></p>
        <p>I’m sitting here, in the local restaurant, and trying their food. It’s so specific and it has a great variety of food. You can find literally anything you want. Something salty, spicy, bitter or sweet. Even though it’s my first time trying their food I enjoyed it! But people there stared at me and were confused. And I totally understand why. It’s their first time seeing someone like me. And if I were them, I’d do the same. Honestly I looked at them like that too! Come on, it’s my first time seeing these creatures! But now, I want to go and see their beautiful places!</p>

        <p><strong>AFTER BREAKFAST</strong></p>
        <p>Visiting their sights right now, so pretty! The streets are full of life, the buildings look absolutely stunning, and details are EVERYTHING! Walking around here feels awesome. The atmosphere feels completely different from what I’m used to. The local markets are full of sounds and smells that are new to me. It’s definitely a place I will always remember!</p>

        <p><strong>THE HOUR I MADE A FRIEND</strong></p>
        <p>You won’t believe me! While I was looking at the historical building, one little girl bumped into me. At first, she was super confused and scared because she never saw someone like me, but then she was interested in me and wanted to know who I am. “What’s your name and where are you from?” she asked me. I said, “My name is REX2089 and I’m from planet Mars”. She couldn’t believe that, she said that aliens are not real and they are just a silly joke. I was about to explain more, but suddenly, she said “okay REX2089 prove it.”</p>

        <p>I didn’t know what to do, because back on my planet, we never had to prove our existence. But here on Earth, humans need to see something with their own eyes. So I thought very hard. What could I show her? My antennas? My wrist communicator? Or maybe a tiny hologram projector in my pocket? I pressed a small button, and suddenly, a little blue star appeared in the air between us, spinning and sparkling. Her mouth opened wide. “Whoa! That’s amazing! Is that even…real?” she said. I nodded proudly. “On Mars, we use this to send messages across the galaxy.” The girl clapped her hands and smiled. “Okay, REX2089 I believe you now!”. And so, at that moment, I realized I had found my very first Earth friend.</p>

        <p><strong>CONTINUATION OF THE DIALOG</strong></p>
        <p>She asked me questions about my home, devices that we use, and other aliens. While I was listening to her, I remembered that I didn’t ask her name. As soon as she ended questioning me, I asked her, “What’s your name by the way?”, she said “My name is Aruzhan, and I’m 10 years old”. I was shocked when she said that she’s 10! She was too smart to be 10 years old. She saw my facial expression and started laughing. “I am too smart for 10 years old, right?” she told me that while smiling at me, and she was totally……. RIGHT!</p>

        <p>We were sitting at the bench and talking, and then I remembered that I forgot my plan! Questions about Space Weather and its impact on people such as farmers, pilots and astronauts.</p>

        <p>////////////////////////</p>
        <p>It took a while for me to think. I decided to move by the plan and asked, “Do you know what space weather is?” I can tell she became so excited right after I told her that. “Yes, of course I do!” she said with her eyes sparkling. “Space weather is a change that happens between the Earth and Sun. Should I tell you more about it?” she asked, looking right at me. I nodded in excitement.</p>

        <p>//////////////////////////////////////</p>
        <p>“I also think that space weather affects jobs in our world.” she said as a note. I didn’t really understand what she meant, so I looked confused. “What do you mean? How?” I asked. It was truly interesting for me to know more. “Actually space weather can lead to bad things and create difficulties for jobs, especially in the sky. Most of them have to prepare for it.” Aruzhan mentioned. I could tell I was shocked... So I said, “Really? Wow, I didn’t even know.”</p>

        <p>She nodded with a smile on her face and added, “That’s true! For example, my dad is a great farmer and he finds it hard to fight with space weather.. He might not know if it will rain or be sunny. That’s why it ruins his harvest and makes it grow so slow.” I almost understood what she said, but then a question came to my mind. I was unsure, so I mumbled “It’s hard only for farmers or others too?” I mumbled. She chuckled at my question. Maybe she noticed my nervousness…</p>

        <p>“No, It’s about all jobs, not only farmers! Pilots, astronauts, engineers or operators can face difficulties too. Any storms or weather problems can mess signals for pilots and they even cancel a flight sometimes. For astronauts, weather problems can be dangerous so they have to stay inside their special building. Also I forgot to say that space weather can cause turning off the light and engineers have to solve this problem..” she mentioned. I cannot describe my expression at that moment. I knew so much new information that I could not even imagine before!</p>
